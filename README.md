# Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model

An open-source Python implementation of the **Black-Scholes model** for European call and put options.  
This project is beginner-friendly and demonstrates how finance uses math to price derivatives.

The Black–Scholes model (1973) gives a formula for pricing European-style options.  
It assumes:
- Stock prices follow a lognormal distribution
- Constant volatility (σ) and risk-free interest rate (r)
- No arbitrage, frictionless markets
- European exercise (only at maturity)
